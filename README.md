## License

This project is open-source and can be freely used. However, please use it responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and game terms of service.

## Source Code

Due to the 3-day time constraint for reverse engineering and coding, the code is not as well-organized as it could be. I should have defined types better and structured the code more clearly. Feel free to improve and refactor it!

---

## Limitations

- This bot currently only works for **Patapon2** replays.
- I have not focused on finding addresses for **Patapon1**, so it's up to you to create a similar bot for **Patapon1**.

---

## Usage

1. **Compile**: The compiled DLL can be found in the `x64\Release` directory. Feel free to compile it yourself if you wish.
   
2. **Inject DLL**: Use a DLL injector (e.g., [ExtremeInjector](https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector)) to inject the DLL when the game starts.

3. **Enjoy**: Launch the game and enjoy watching the bot in action!
